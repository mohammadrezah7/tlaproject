# Python generators are useful for Turing machines because they invert control
# over to the caller. They can generate an output stream lazily
# Iterators allow lazy evaluation, only generating the next element of an iterable object when requested.
# This is useful for very large data sets.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# >>> x = (i ** 2 for i in range(1, 10))
# >>> next(x)
# 1
# >>> next(x)
# 4
# >>> next(x)
# 9
#
# This means that you could construct a Turing Machine lazily, repeatedly
# ask for output with next, _only when needed_, or collect all its outputs
# if needed
#
# EXAMPLE:
# >>> x = (i ** 2 for i in range(1, 10))
# >>> list(x)
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81
# generator could write a function that
#         potentially runs forever and it's up the the caller to decide how many
#         steps are executed. We give the user control to execute us one step at a time. This
#         is what Python generators are (partially) for. The yield expression
#         suspends us and gives controll to the caller until he or she decides to
#         resume our execution.
# Because execution is done in a generator, it’s possible to have infinite executions
#         but the acceptance checks are limited by the number of steps they are allowed to perform.
